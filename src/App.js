        <p>
          <b>Lorem Ipsum</b> is simply dummy text of the printing and
          typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard
          dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley
          of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived
          not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
          typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in
          the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum
          passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like
          Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum

        <h2>Why do we use it?</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Lorem Ipsum</b> It is a long established fact that a reader will be
          distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its
          layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less
          normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here,
          content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop
          publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their
          default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many
          web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over
          the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected
          humour and the like).

        <h2>Where does it come from?</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Lorem Ipsum</b> Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not
          simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin
          literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard
          McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia,
          looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a
          Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in
          classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum
          comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et
          Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC.
          This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during
          the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit
          amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

        <h2>Where can I get some?</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Lorem Ipsum</b> There are many variations of passages of Lorem
          Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some
          form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even
          slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum,
          you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the
          middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to
          repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true
          generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin
          words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to
          generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum
          is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or
          non-characteristic words etc.
